# Flask Web App - Complete Summary

## Status: ✅ RUNNING

**URL**: http://localhost:5000

## What Just Got Built

A complete web interface for the Hivemind multi-space system with:

### 🎯 Core Features

1. **Space Management**
   - Create spaces (1:1, group, public)
   - Join with invite codes
   - View members and policies
   - Browse conversation feeds

2. **Invite Code System** ⭐
   - Auto-generated 8-character hex codes
   - Share codes to invite others
   - Simple join workflow
   - Notifications when people join

3. **Consent Layer (Approvals)** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Review content before sharing
   - See filtered/transformed content
   - Approve, edit, or reject
   - Confidence/sensitivity scores
   - **This is THE key feature from the transcript!**

4. **Policy Templates**
   - Couples: Share emotions, exclude work
   - Team: Share work, exclude personal
   - Public: Share insights, heavy anonymization

5. **Testing/Simulation**
   - Dashboard simulator to test routing
   - See how conversations route to spaces
   - Generate pending approvals

## Quick Test Workflow

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Login** as "Andrew" (any username works)
3. **Create Space**:
   - Name: "Andrew & Jamila"
   - Type: One-on-One
   - Policy: Couples
   - You'll get an invite code like: `F7D6F71B`
4. **Copy the invite code**
5. **Logout**, login as "Jamila"
6. **Join Space** using the invite code
7. **Logout**, login as "Andrew" again
8. **Test the Simulator** (on dashboard):
   - Enter: "I'm feeling stressed about work lately"
   - Click "Simulate Routing"
   - Watch it route to your couples space
9. **Check Approvals** page if content was flagged
10. **Review and approve/edit/reject**

## How Invite Codes Work

### Creating a Space
```python
# User creates space
space = manager.create_space(
    user.user_id,
    "Andrew & Jamila",
    SpaceType.ONE_ON_ONE,
    policy_template="couples"
)

# Auto-generated invite code
print(space.invite_code)  # "F7D6F71B"
```

### Sharing the Code
- Currently: Manual (copy/paste, Signal, email, etc.)
- Future: In-app invites, notifications, QR codes

### Joining with Code
```python
# Jamila receives code "F7D6F71B"
# She enters it on the "Join Space" page
success = manager.join_space(
    space.space_id,
    jamila.user_id,
    "F7D6F71B"  # The invite code
)

# If successful:
# - Jamila is added to space
# - Andrew gets notification
# - Both can see each other in members list
```

### Group Spaces
- Same invite code for everyone
- Unlimited members (for group type)
- Everyone uses same code to join
- Can see all members after joining

## Alignment with Transcript Vision

### ✅ Implemented

| Feature | Transcript Quote | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Consent Layer | "it like bounces what you just said against all of your policies and says, Hey, I think this might be good to share with this group you want to" | ✅ Approvals page |
| Multi-space | "you have like, one to one to many groups and whatever connection" | ✅ 1:1, group, public |
| Policy Templates | "you probably want to have an agent that helps you just craft the policy... because nobody's ever going to write their policies" | ✅ 3 templates |
| Invite System | "Trust: know who created the space" | ✅ Codes + creator shown |

### ⏳ Partially Implemented

| Feature | What's Missing |
|---------|----------------|
| Notifications | No real-time (websockets) |
| Member Management | Can't remove members, no roles |
| Invite Management | No expiration, no revocation |
| Space Discovery | No public feed browsing |

### ❌ Not Yet Started

| Feature | Why Important |
|---------|---------------|
| Meta-Agent | Help users create custom policies |
| Discovery Engine | Match users with similar interests |
| Real-time Streaming | See active conversations |
| Dynamic Tool Defs | Adapt based on user behavior |

## Architecture

```
User Browser
     ↓
Flask Web App (web_app.py)
     ↓
SpaceManager (src/space_manager.py)
     ↓
PolicyEngine (src/policy_engine.py)
     ↓
In-Memory Storage
(will be Firestore)
```

## Integration Points

### With MCP Server (Next Step)
```python
# MCP server will use same backend
from src.space_manager import SpaceManager
from src.policy_engine import PolicyEngine

# When Claude processes conversation:
turn = RawConversationTurn(...)
results = await policy_engine.route_conversation(turn, user_id)

# If approval needed:
# - Add to pending_approvals
# - User sees it in web UI
# - User approves/rejects in browser
# - MCP server reads decision
```

### With Claude Code
```
User talks to Claude
     ↓
MCP tool: log_conversation_turn
     ↓
PolicyEngine routes through policies
     ↓
If needs approval → Web UI
If auto-approved → Stored in space
     ↓
MCP tool: read_space
     ↓
Claude gets context for next conversation
```

## Current Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage**
   - Data lost on restart
   - No persistence
   - No multi-instance support

2. **No Real Auth**
   - Demo mode only
   - No passwords
   - No session security

3. **No Real-Time**
   - No websockets
   - Manual refresh needed
   - No live updates

4. **Basic Features Only**
   - Can't edit policies
   - Can't remove members
   - Can't archive spaces
   - No search/filter

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Fix SpaceType enum values (just fixed!)
2. Add sample data for easier testing
3. Test all workflows end-to-end

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
1. Create MCP tools that use SpaceManager
2. Add `create_space` tool
3. Add `join_space` tool
4. Enhanced `log_conversation_turn` with routing
5. Add `view_pending_approvals` tool
6. Add `approve_disclosure` tool

### Phase 4: Persistence
1. Migrate to Firestore
2. Add proper authentication
3. Session management
4. Real-time updates

5. **Consent Layer** (2 min)
   - Review pending approval
   - Show scores
   - Edit content

6. **Outro** (30 sec)
   - Recap key features
   - Next steps (MCP integration)

Total: ~7 minutes

## Quotes from Transcript - NOW WORKING

> "you want, like, a really easy consent layer"
**✅ Approvals page provides this**

> "it like bounces what you just said against all of your policies and says, Hey, I think this might be good to share with this group you want to"
**✅ Simulator + Approvals does this**

> "you probably want some type of evaluation on, like, some common policies, because nobody's ever going to write their policies"
**✅ Three policy templates provided**

> "it's like a social network. So you have like, one to one to many groups"
**✅ Space types: 1:1, group, public**

## Bottom Line

We now have a **fully functional web interface** for:
- Creating and managing spaces
- Sharing and using invite codes
- Reviewing and approving content (THE KEY FEATURE!)
- Simulating conversation routing
- Viewing notifications

**This implements the core consent layer from the transcript.**

**Next**: Connect this to Claude via MCP tools so conversations automatically flow through the system.
