# Hivemind Multi-Space Implementation Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

**Date**: January 2025

### What We Built

#### 1. Data Models (`src/models.py`)
- ✅ User model with consent configuration
- ✅ Space model (supports 1:1, group, public)
- ✅ Policy model with comprehensive filtering rules
- ✅ SpaceMember and SpaceSettings
- ✅ RawConversationTurn (for local storage)
- ✅ FilteredDocument (for shared content)
- ✅ PendingApproval (for approval queue)
- ✅ Three policy templates:
  - `create_couples_policy()` - For 1:1 relationships
  - `create_public_feed_policy()` - For public feeds
  - `create_team_policy()` - For team/group coordination

#### 2. Space Manager (`src/space_manager.py`)
- ✅ User management (create, get)
- ✅ Space CRUD operations (create, get, list)
- ✅ Invite code generation and validation
- ✅ Join/leave space functionality
- ✅ Member limits enforcement (e.g., max 2 for 1:1)
- ✅ Policy updates
- ✅ In-memory storage (will migrate to Firestore)

#### 3. Test Suite
- ✅ `tests/test_models.py` - 15 tests for data models
- ✅ `tests/test_space_manager.py` - 17 tests for space operations
- ✅ Comprehensive scenarios:
  - Couples onboarding flow
  - Hacker house group creation
  - User with multiple spaces
- ✅ Test runner script (`run_tests.py`)

### Test Results

```bash
tests/test_models.py::15 PASSED (0.20s)
tests/test_space_manager.py::17 PASSED (0.16s)

Total: 32/32 tests passing ✓
```

### Key Features Working

1. **Space Creation**
   ```python
   space = manager.create_space(
       creator_user_id="usr_123",
       name="Andrew & Jamila",
       space_type=SpaceType.ONE_ON_ONE,
       policy_template="couples"
   )
   # Returns space with invite code, policy, and settings
   ```

2. **Invite System**
   ```python
   # User 1 creates space, gets invite code
   invite_code = space.invite_code  # e.g., "A7B2C9D1"

   # User 2 joins with code
   manager.join_space(space.space_id, user2.user_id, invite_code)
   ```

3. **Policy Templates**
   - Couples: Share emotional state, exclude work details
   - Public: Share insights, heavily anonymize
   - Team: Share work progress, keep technical details

4. **Space Constraints**
   - 1:1 spaces auto-limit to 2 members
   - Public spaces allow open joining
   - Empty private spaces auto-delete

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Policy Engine (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Route conversation turns through policies to appropriate spaces

### What We Built

1. **Policy Engine** (`src/policy_engine.py`) ✅
   - Takes RawConversationTurn + User's spaces
   - Runs each space's policy (relevance, filtering, transformation)
   - Returns FilteredDocuments for each relevant space
   - Queues high-sensitivity items for approval
   - Mock LLM for testing (real Claude API ready to integrate)

2. **Tests** (`tests/test_policy_engine.py`) ✅
   - ✅ Test relevance detection
   - ✅ Test filtering (remove PII/names)
   - ✅ Test transformation (generalize details)
   - ✅ Test approval queue logic
   - ✅ Test multi-space routing
   - **11 tests, all passing**

3. **Demo** (`demo_policy_engine.py`) ✅
   - Shows couples space routing
   - Demonstrates multi-space routing
   - Shows content filtering/transformation
   - Demonstrates approval workflow

### Architecture

```
RawConversationTurn
        ↓
    Policy Engine
        ↓
    ┌───────┬───────┬───────┐
Space 1   Space 2  Space 3  Approval Queue
(filtered) (filtered) (skip)  (high risk)
```

### API

```python
engine = PolicyEngine(manager)

results = await engine.route_conversation(
    turn=RawConversationTurn(...),
    user_id="usr_123"
)

# Returns:
# [
#   RouteResult(space_id="spc_1", doc=FilteredDoc(...)),
#   RouteResult(space_id="spc_2", action="approval_needed"),
#   RouteResult(space_id="spc_3", action="skipped")
# ]
```

## 📋 Phase 3: MCP Server Updates (PENDING)

**Goal**: Expose new tools to Claude

### New Tools to Add

1. `create_space` - Create new space
2. `join_space` - Join with invite code
3. `list_spaces` - See user's spaces
4. `log_conversation_turn` - Enhanced with routing
5. `read_space` - Get context from space

### Current Status

- ✅ Old `log_conversation_turn` exists (single feed)
- ⏳ Need to update for multi-space routing
- ⏳ Need to add space management tools

---

## 🎯 Phase 4: End-to-End Test (PENDING)

**Goal**: Full scenario from user creation to content sharing

### Test Scenario

1. Andrew creates account
2. Andrew creates 1:1 space with couples policy
3. Jamila joins space
4. Andrew has conversation mentioning stress + Jamila
5. Policy engine routes to:
   - Jamila space: "Feeling stressed. Could use support."
   - Public feed: (skipped, too personal)
6. Jamila reads space, sees context
7. Verify PII was removed

---

## 📊 Metrics

### Code Stats
- **5 new files**: models.py, space_manager.py, policy_engine.py, 3 test files, 3 demo files
- **~2,500 lines of code**
- **43 passing tests** (15 models + 17 space + 11 policy engine)
- **0 test failures**

### Feature Completeness
- ✅ Data models: 100%
- ✅ Space management: 100%
- ✅ Policy engine: 100% (with mock LLM)
- ⏳ MCP integration: 0%

## 📝 Design Decisions

### Why In-Memory First?
- Faster iteration during development
- Easy to test without Firestore setup
- Can migrate to Firestore without changing API

### Why Policy Templates?
- Common use cases need sensible defaults
- Users can customize after installing
- Reduces onboarding friction

### Why Explicit Invite Codes?
- Privacy: spaces are opt-in
- Security: can't accidentally join
- Trust: know who created the space

### Why Max Members for 1:1?
- Enforces the 1:1 contract
- Prevents confusion about audience
- Different policies for different space types

---

## 🚀 Demo-able Scenarios

### 1. Couples Setup (Works Now!)
```python
manager = SpaceManager()
andrew = manager.create_user("Andrew")
space = manager.create_space(andrew.user_id, "Andrew & Jamila", "1:1", policy_template="couples")
invite_code = space.invite_code

jamila = manager.create_user("Jamila")
manager.join_space(space.space_id, jamila.user_id, invite_code)

# Both can see space
assert len(manager.list_user_spaces(andrew.user_id)) == 1
assert len(manager.list_user_spaces(jamila.user_id)) == 1
```

### 2. Hacker House (Works Now!)
```python
manager = SpaceManager()
andrew = manager.create_user("Andrew")
pirate_ship = manager.create_space(andrew.user_id, "Pirate Ship", "group", policy_template="team")

# Multiple people join
for name in ["Novel", "Alexis", "Ron"]:
    user = manager.create_user(name)
    manager.join_space(pirate_ship.space_id, user.user_id, pirate_ship.invite_code)

# Everyone sees the space
assert len(pirate_ship.members) == 4
```

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **Pydantic is powerful** - Serialization to/from dicts is trivial
2. **Test-first works** - 32 tests caught several edge cases
3. **Policy templates matter** - Default configs are critical for UX
4. **Invite codes are simple** - 8-char hex strings work great
5. **Fixtures are your friend** - pytest fixtures keep tests clean
